							Paris has been drawing visitors for centuries. From its wonderful
							historic monuments to its exceptional cuisine, it is a destination
							unlike any other. Wandering in and out of museums, cafes,
							beautiful gardens, and enjoying the romance of the city. You will
							take in the view from the Eiffel Tower, say hi to Mona Lisa in the
							Louvre, eat street food crepes, climb the Arc de Triomphe, explore
							several Parisian neighborhoods, and visit the amazing Palace of
							Versailles.
