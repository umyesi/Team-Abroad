              Paris has been drawing visitors for centuries. From its wonderful
              historic monuments to its exceptional cuisine, it is a destination
              unlike any other. Wandering in and out of museums, cafes,
              beautiful gardens, and enjoying the romance of the city. You will
              take in the view from the Eiffel Tower, say hi to Mona Lisa in the
              Louvre, eat street food crepes, climb the Arc de Triomphe, explore
              several Parisian neighborhoods, and visit the amazing Palace of
              Versailles.
